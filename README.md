# How we made it

Sinigang was created by Greenhouse Game dev, a group within the SCU Imaginarium for our Winter 2024 project. We wanted to create a cozy game for the winter, and we ended up landing on a cooking game set in a childhood home.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We used the Unity, C#, and the Unity XR toolkit for the programming.
